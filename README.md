### Project Vision
PrivGeo is a privacy-preserving geofencing system designed for organizations which prioritize location privacy while needing flexible geofencing capabilities. PrivGeo supports complex non-convex polygon geofences, enabling precise boundary definitions without exposing user location data. Leveraging the Paillier encryption scheme, PrivGeo ensures full location privacy, offering a practical, real-time, and scalable solution. This system is ideal for applications that demand advanced geofencing while maintaining user trust by keeping location information secure, thereby promoting the broader adoption of location-based services in privacy-sensitive contexts.
